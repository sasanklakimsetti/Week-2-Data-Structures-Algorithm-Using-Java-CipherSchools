Sorting

ex: 4 2 9 10 7

*sort them in ascending order

sorted: 2 4 7 9 10

approach 1 : pick smallest number and keep it at front.

1)pick the min element
2)keep in front
3)search for next

step-1: 2 4 9 10 7
step-2: 2 4 9 10 7
step-3: 2 4 9 10 7
step-4: 2 4 9 10 9
step-5: 2 4 7 9 10 (sorted)

time complexity: O(N-1)

**this approach is called Selection Sort
